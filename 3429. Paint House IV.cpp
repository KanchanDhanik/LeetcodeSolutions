/*ðŸ§© Problem Understanding
You're given:

n = 4 houses

Each house can be painted in 3 colors: 0, 1, or 2

cost[i][j] = cost to paint house i with color j

Rules:

No two adjacent houses (i.e., i and i+1) can have the same color.

Also, each house is considered adjacent to its mirror house at index n - i - 1. So house 0 is adjacent to house 3, house 1 to house 2, and vice versa.

ðŸ§  Approach
We must pick a color for each house such that:

Adjacent and mirror houses have different colors

The total painting cost is minimized

We use dynamic programming to try all combinations of valid colorings:

For each pair (i, n - i - 1), choose two different colors

For each such choice, recursively compute the cost for remaining houses

Track and return the minimum among all valid combinations
